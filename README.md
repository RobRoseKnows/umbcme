# UMBC.me API
## Develop applications using UMBC Course data

## What is it?
UMBC.me is an unofficial comprehensive API for UMBC data. Currently it includes course information, but we plan on expanding it to include much more.

## Why?
The UMBC.me API exists in order to aid in the development of applications to make it easier for students to manage courses and their semester in general.

## What does it have?
Currently UMBC.me only includes data on courses for the Fall 2017 semester. We plan on expanding the API to include more semester data into the future.

## Is it free?
Yes, UMBC.me is entirely free and open to the public for use underneath the MIT License.
